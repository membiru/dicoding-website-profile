            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>I am a sixth semester Computer Science student at University of Lambung Mangkurat. I interested to learn new things, especially in IT and programming. Apart from college, I also developing my skills in the field of programming by starting with the IDCamp program (by Indosat) in 2019, BANGKIT 2021 program (led by Google, Tokopedia, Gojek, & Traveloka) in the mobile development learning path. And currently in 2022, I follow MBKM program again partner by Ruangguru in Frontend Web Developer learning path. I like and love playing games since I was a child, my favorite genre is RPG. Completing difficult missions and finding out hidden missions is an interesting part of playing games. Personally, that feeling is what I feel when doing programming, being happy when the function works properly. Now, I am looking to further develop and use my skills in a year in industry placement, specifically as a programmer.</p>
